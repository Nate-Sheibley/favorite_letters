## Methodology
>letter popularity poll
what are YOUR favorite Latin letters? rate as many of these letters as you want on a scale from 0 to 6, where your least favorite letters are 0 and your favorite letters are 6.
>
>  do not feel obligated to provide a rating for every single letter. the order is randomized and all questions are optional, so it's completely fine to only partially fill out the form.
>
>  only characters included in Unicode 16.0 as Latin letters are listed here. "modifier letters" and certain compatibility characters are not counted.
