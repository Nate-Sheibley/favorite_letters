English letters scored high in rating, and low in variation. As a whole, they are statistically different than less common latin letters (this is an english survey on an english social media platform). As is intuitive, there is one outlier in english letters in average as well as standard deviation.

The outlier with a low average is l (lowercase L). 

The most polarizing letter with a outlier high variation is O (capital o).

This may be because of the familiarity with the letters. The font used was Arial, an extremely common font, so uncommon forms of letters were not present. Some fonts use less common, alternate glyphs for letters like a or g that could have influenced the ratings.

## Restrictions on results

We can not know if this is influenced by font. This survery was conduction on google forms deafult font Arial.
